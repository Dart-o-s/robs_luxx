## Lox Dart

An interpreter for the [Lox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters) programming language wrote in Dart.

### Upgrades and History

Most of the work here is based on Roboli's implementation of the Lox language. I renamed it to Luxx and put in some "Upgrades".
This Git repository is new, I just wanted to push it upwards. So forgive me the bad shape, I will fix that.

The purpose of the language is to be a scripting language for a simple HyperCard clone. Also as I am interested in language design, I upgraded the language a bit, see: plan.md
